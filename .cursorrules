# Universal Martial Arts Center, Website

This is a gym website built with Next.js. You are updating it for Universal Martial Arts Center,.

## Project Structure
- `pages/` or `app/` - Main page components
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `public/` - Static assets (images, etc.)
- `styles/` - CSS and theme configuration
- `vercel.json` - Vercel-level redirects (case-sensitive)
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js config (path-based redirects only)

## When Updating Content
- Keep the existing component structure intact
- Update text content to match the target gym
- Replace placeholder images with real ones from the gym's website
- Keep the template's existing fonts and color scheme (don't copy their old site's styling)
- Update favicon (/app/favicon.ico) with the gym's logo
- IMPORTANT: Find and verify their actual social media links from their website footer/header
  - Don't leave placeholder social links - use their real profiles or remove if they don't have them

## Redirects (CRITICAL)
Case-sensitive redirects MUST go in `vercel.json`, NOT `next.config.ts`:
- /Contact → /contact = vercel.json
- /About → /about = vercel.json
- /Classes → /classes = vercel.json

This prevents redirect loops with Vercel's www domain redirects.

Path-based redirects can stay in next.config.ts:
- /testimonials → /reviews = next.config.ts
- /classes/:path* → /classes = next.config.ts

## SEO Requirements
- Every page needs a unique, descriptive title tag with gym name and location
- Add meta descriptions (150-160 chars) with relevant keywords
- Use proper heading hierarchy (one H1 per page, followed by H2s, H3s)
- Add alt text to all images
- Include structured data for local business schema
- Add OpenGraph meta tags for social sharing

## AI Integration
- The org ID and phone number are already configured in `.env.local`
- Contact forms and AI features will work automatically
- Don't modify the API routes or AI integration code

## Guidelines
- Use semantic HTML for SEO and accessibility
- Maintain accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Keep the responsive design working
- Test on mobile and desktop views

## After Completing Updates
Run `git add . && git commit -m "Updated for Universal Martial Arts Center," && git push` to deploy.
